Those lips that Love's own hand did make Breathed forth the sound that said "I hate" To me that languished for her sake;

2
Poor soul, the center of my sinful earth, Pressed with these rebel powers that thee array, Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth,

My love is as a fever, longing still For that which longer nurseth the disease, Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill,

Two loves I have, of comfort and despair, That like two spirits do suggest me still. My better angel is a man right fair,
